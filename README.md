Notes to the Grader:
- Snowman:
    - I place the camera to make the snowman be looked from the front
    - I make the AmbientLight as white
    - I make a white pointLight which shines on the top
    - I use Sphere to make the bodies and head, and also two eyes
    - I use Cone to make the nose
    - I use Cylinser and Ring to make a hat of the snowman
    - I add a pointLinght which is "light yellow" (a fake sunlight) comes from left
- Museum
    - I place a astronaut in it
    - I place a simple-version snowman in it, the rotation can be seen by its very tiny nose
        - The snowman probably looks little wired because of the requirement, I used some "weird" materials and status on it, but the whole shape is still a snowman
    - I place a cone in it
    - The snowman and the cone have different materials
    - four lights are lighting on each object
    - when click on camera, different camera will focus on one specific object
